will need 3 pointers 
ptr-node current-node next-node
- intlize prev_node to null and current-node to head
- while current node is not null
	- set next-node to current-node.next
	- set current-node.next to prev-node
	- set prev-node to curnode and cur node to next-node
	- set head to prev-node

**queue**: 
- remove: at, insert, set, push-back, front, and erease. functions. 
- rename append to push, back to peak, pop-back to pop. 
- use head and tail nodes.  
**stack**:
- remove: at, insert, set, append, erease, back. functions. 
- rename: push-back to push, pop-back to pop, and front to peak.
