## parts of memory


os kernel
stack (local vars, and functions)
shared libs
heap (Dynamic memory)
read/write segment .data .bss
readonly Segment .text .rodata (this is where the code is)

### mem during execution
int f(int,int);
int g(int);

int main(int argc, char** argv){
	int n1 = f(3,-5);
	n1=g(n1);
}

int f(){
	int x;
	int a[3];
	//....
	x=g(a[3]);
	return x;
}

os
stack
main(argc, argv) and n1 (this is a frame)
.
.
.


when f() is executed, it, and all its vars are loaded into mem as a new frame.

as functions are called they are loaded into mem.
And when the function ends, and returns its value.
It will be removed from mem.


### pointers:

- it points to somewhere int the process' virtual space.
- &foo produces the virtual address of foo. (the address in mem wher foo is stored.)

int x; //just a var.
int *p; // this is a var that can store mem addresses.
	// can also be written: int* p;
p=&x; //loads address of x into p.
*p=56; //puts 56 in x. since p refers to the address of x.


int *p1, p2; // this makes one pointer p1, and one int p2.
