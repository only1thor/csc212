# Title

## find preconditions for your functions
- ask for expected input range. 
- make sure inputs are correct, do tests. 
	* assert - terminate if false ( assert(n>0); usefull for debugging only.) 
	* trow, try, catch ( trows exception that can be cought later)
	* or just let the program misbehave, or crash at some point. 

## making a recursive function:
- solve the task by using smaller tastks of the same structure. 
- technically, a recursive function is one that calls it self. 
- in general form:
	* base case (solution for trivial case)
	it also used te stop the recursion. 
	* recursive calls.
