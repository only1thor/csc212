# Sorting algs, what's the most efficient. 

## Insertion sort.
an inversion is a pair of keys that are out of order. 
(it's basically a swap)
for partially-sorted array, insertion sort runs in linear time. 

## Stability. 
a stable sorting alg will preserve the order of items of the same value. 

take listing a plane departure table as an example. 
if the alg is stable and the list is sorted by departure times, and you 
sort it by name of destination, the times of the departures for a single 
destination will be in order of departure time. 

if the alg is not. you will get a jumble. 

### note: 
long distance swaps cause an alg to be non-stable. 
insertion sort is strable. 

# summary
table: 
|     | best case | average-case | worst-case | stable? | inplace? |
| --- |---	| ---		| ---		| ---   | ---	|
| selection sort | 0(n²) | 0(n²) | 0(n²) | no | yes |
| Insertion sort | 0(n) | 0(n²) | 0(n²) | yes | yes |
