# empirical analysis
- implement alg
- run on different input sizes
- record actuall runnig times
- calculate hypothesis
- predict and validate. 

limitations: 
- requires implementing multiple algs for the same problem
	- may be diggicult and timeconsuming
	- implementtation details also play a role (one partiular alg 
	  may be "better written")
- requires extensive testing
	- time consuming
	- choice of testcases might favor one of the algs. 
- variations in HW, SW, and OS affect analysis. 

# Mathematical Modeling
-high-level analysis - no need to impliment
- computatianal cost number og basic operations required by the alg to 
imput... too sloooow. 

- analyze alg
- develop alg.
